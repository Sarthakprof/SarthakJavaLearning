		 * Primitive Data Types
		 * 
		 * Data types that can store integer values:
		 * 
		 * int i; byte b; short s; long l;
		 * 
		 * Variable types:
		 * 
		 * byte b = 5; //8bits - 128 to 127 short s = 128 //16bits - 32,768 to 32,767
		 * int i = 40000; //32 bits - 2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 long l = 222222222;
		 * //64bits -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 float f =
		 * 4.0f; //32 bits NOT very precise, don't use for financials double d = 67.0
		 * //64bits NOT very precise, don't use for financials char c = 'A'; //16bits
		 * '\u0000' to '\uffff' boolean isPrime = false; //true or false
		 * 
		 * For example:
		 * 
		 * Example 1: To store number of goals in a football match we can use either
		 * byte or short data type and declare it as below: short numberOfGoals;
		 * 
		 * Example 2: To store population of world, use long data type long population;
		 * 
		 * Example 3: To store average of two number, use double for all decimal
		 * operation double average;
		 * 
		 * Example 4: To store Grades of students, use char data type char grade; grade
		 * = 'A'
		 * 
		 * Example 5: To check whether a number is even or odd, use boolean type boolean
		 * isEven; isEven = false;
